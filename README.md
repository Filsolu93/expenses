# project3

In the previous unit, we built and deployed our first static React application to GitHub Pages. In this unit, we will integrate React as the View layer into a full-stack web application using the MVC paradigm and deploy it to Heroku. The stack we will work with is known as MERN, short for MongoDB Express React and Node. 

## Key Topics
